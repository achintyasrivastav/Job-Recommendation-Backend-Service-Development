# Job Recommendation Backend Service Development

This project implements a new feature for an AI-powered talent acquisition platform that recommends relevant job postings to users based on their profiles and preferences. The job recommendation system uses a content-based recommendation algorithm incorporating **TF-IDF** and **keyword matching**.
