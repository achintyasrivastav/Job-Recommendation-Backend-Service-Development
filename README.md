# Job-Recommendation-Backend-Service-Development
Develop a new feature for an AI-powered talent acquisition platform that recommends relevant job postings to users based on their profiles and preferences. The task involves building backend services, designing a suitable database architecture, and implementing a recommendation algorithm. A job recommendation system that suggests jobs to users based on their preferences and qualifications. It uses a content-based recommendation algorithm, incorporating TF-IDF and keyword matching.

Features
Content-based job recommendation using TF-IDF scores.
Keyword matching fallback for job suggestions when TF-IDF scores are low.
API endpoints for job CRUD operations and fetching recommendations.
MongoDB as the database for storing job postings and user data.
Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Node.js and npm installed
MongoDB installed and running
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/job-recommendation-system.git
cd job-recommendation-system
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
npm install
Set up environment variables:
Create a .env file in the root of the project based on .env.example.
bash
Copy code
cp .env.example .env
Edit the .env file with your MongoDB connection string:
bash
Copy code
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/job-recommendation-db
Start the MongoDB service.

Run the application:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The server should be running at http://localhost:3000.

API Endpoints
GET /jobs – Fetch all job postings.
GET /jobs/:job_id – Fetch a job by ID.
POST /jobs – Add a new job posting.
POST /jobs/recommendations – Get job recommendations based on user profile.
Recommendation Logic
Preprocessing: Text data (job titles, skills, etc.) is tokenized and cleaned by removing stop words.
TF-IDF Match: Calculates a match score based on user preferences and job requirements.
Keyword Matching Fallback: If TF-IDF scores are too low, a keyword-based matching algorithm suggests jobs.
